YASI == Yet Another Stupid Idea (acronym taken from nethack btw)

Races/factions:

	Archaic humans:
		Using shitty 100 times broken and 100 times fixed machinery. They have strong units with friendly fire. 
	
	Transhumanists:
		More advanced than humans. Have variuous fancy enhancements on themselves. Small armies of overpowered and overspecialised units. Every unit starts as a same base type and then receives a series of upgrades to become strong.
	
	Deteriorating AI:
		Very advanced. Highest mobility, swarm units and powerful hard-hitters. Don't have traditional army production buildings, but can spawn units anywhere withing the range of their controll.


Map features:

> Arbitrary number of z-levels
> Teleporters in map
> Neutral buildings (teleporters)

Additional nice to have features:
> XOR upgrades (either one upgrade, or another, but not both)
> Soft cap on army size (aka. reduced resource extraction after hitting soft ceiling)
> Soft cap on resource extraction (eg. 90% less resources extracted in depleted areas, but never zero).
> 2 main resources. Choose one:
	> SC/WC style minerals & gas / gold & lumber. Both extracted similar way.
	> ZeroK/ OpenRA style: one traditional (minerals) and another produced by dedicated buildings (energy)
	> Mix of both (eg. geothermal extractors in ZeroK)?
> Make game playable and interesting early into developement by adding gamemodes:
	> Defense from waves of enemies (eg. ZeroK chickens)
	> Siege gamemode (attack defending and fortified bot player).
	> Figure out a way to attract AI students to build smart bots for this game (probably won't happen in early developement).
	> Single player campaign, with missions where player controls or has access to a limited number of units.
	> Epic multiplayer team vs team battles with big armies and lots of units (imagine ZeroK 7v7 games that last for ~1 hour or more)
