# YASI == Yet Another Stupid Idea

###What the game should have and what it shouldn't have:
	
It should be very similar to SC1/SCBW/SC:R gameplay wise.

On top of basic SC1 formula I believe the game should add:

- Better UI. Especially spellcasting, to allow efficient casting spells even if multiple units are selected. Also allow for efficient unit training when multiple buildings are selected at once.
- New unit designs. Create own, steal/copy form other games. As long as it ends up fun.

However, I think these SC1 features are should not be included:

- Unit selection cap. It is mostly inconvenience. Better give player who splits army into groups a soft advantage through the way unit AI behaves (eg. spliting army into separate control groups gives better control and more opportunities for surround compared to single control group for all units).
- Army size cap. I think there should be soft cap. My idea is to have every unit's cost scale with supply after soft cap has been reached.
- Perma-invis combat units (dark templar). Just anti fun mechanic. Invis should be in the game but either when stationary (eg. lurkers) or disabled for a period after agressive action (eg. riki from Dota2).
- Dark Swarm. It is just bad design to balance whole match up through one overpowered spell.
- Bugs/features that depend on how SC1 engine works. Such as muta stacking, hold position with overlords & lurkers. Reason is that AutumnRTS is its own engine with its own bugs/features and it's bad taste to try to replicate the bugs of other engines.

Why design after SC1 and and not SC2? Because in my opinion SC2 has 2 very big problems (at least when I played it):

- Deathball mechanics. Looks ugly and makes battles worse than in SC1. Multiple small battles across the map is much more cool than 2 balls of units running into each other. Custom game called starbow actually solved it by making unit AI spread out more instead of clumping up into massive ball. 
- Hard counters. In my experience SC2 unit counters were stronger than in SC1. While having strong counters adds weight to strategic decisions, having only soft counters gives more importance to tactics, micromanagement and economy (=army size).

 Some other RTS game features that I don't plan to add:
 
 - Real 3d terrain. In my experience it ends up making game feel very slow (cos armies slow down when going uphill)
 - Simulated projectiles. Unnecesary layer of complexity.
 - Terraforming/changing map layout. Cool, but unnecesary layer of complexity. Building intricate base layouts should be enough. 
- Hero units. 
- Vehicles crushing infantry. Cool concept, but also anti-fun.
 
 

### Lore

Please read BLAME! manga (but don't watch the netflix adaptation, it's shit). Once you finish reading it you will understand what I want the lore to look like.


Races/factions:

**Archaic humans:**

Using shitty 100 times broken and 100 times fixed machinery. They have strong units with friendly fire. 
	
**Transhumanists:**

More advanced than humans. Have variuous fancy enhancements on themselves. Small armies of overpowered and overspecialised units. Every unit starts as a same base type and then receives a series of upgrades to become strong.
	
**Deteriorating AI:**

Very advanced. Highest mobility, swarm units and powerful hard-hitters. Don't have traditional army production buildings, but can spawn units anywhere withing the range of their controll.


### Map features:

> Arbitrary number of z-levels
> Teleporters in map
> Neutral buildings (teleporters & destructible obstacles)

### Additional nice to have features:

- XOR upgrades (either one upgrade, or another, but not both)
- Soft cap on army size (aka. reduced resource extraction after hitting soft ceiling)
- Soft cap on resource extraction (eg. 90% less resources extracted in depleted areas, but never zero).
- 2 main resources. Choose one:
- - SC/WC style minerals & gas / gold & lumber. Both extracted similar way.
- - ZeroK/ OpenRA style: one traditional (minerals) and another produced by dedicated buildings (energy)
- - Mix of both (eg. geothermal extractors in ZeroK)?
- Make game playable and interesting early into developement by adding gamemodes:
- - Defense from waves of enemies (eg. ZeroK chickens)
- - Siege gamemode (attack defending and fortified bot player).
- - Figure out a way to attract AI students to build smart bots for this game (probably won't happen in early developement).
- - Single player campaign, with missions where player controls or has access to a limited number of units.
- - Epic multiplayer team vs team battles with big armies and lots of units (imagine ZeroK 7v7 games that last for ~1 hour or more)
